                    <h3>The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern</h3>
                    <p>I absolutely love writing style. 
                        There was a good balance of blurbs of outsiders’ point-of-view and a character’s inner monologue.
                        The descriptions of the scenery and objects such as the clocks were some of the best I've read in fiction.

                <h3>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint by Sing Shong</h3>
                <p>Best novel I have read so far. 1000/10. The characters were so good, I especially liked Kim Dokja. 
                    His loser personality was extremely relatable while his cunningness made me aspire to be him. 
                    I also loved Yoo Joonhyuk and Han Sooyoung. 
                    Both characters have their own nuances and strengths, especially Han Sooyoung. I didn’t originally like her because she was an enemy, but by the end, she was the character that I related to the most. 
                    Her and YJH’s loyalty to KDJ is honestly astonishing. 
                    Everything ties back together, even how KDJ seems invincible in the series and I feel like that is something I have not seen before. 
                    The ending was so tragic, but so fitting. It’s one of the best endings I’ve seen in a while, comparable to Song of Achilles in its own way. 
                    The open-endedness reminded me of Banana Fish and really allowed the reader to put the rightful ending. 
                    The book also brings readers into the book implicitly which is something I admire. Since ORV is a story about a reader, it is only right to also bring in the readers of this story. </p>

                <h3>The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss</h3>
                <p>The book follows Kvothe, a retired noturious wizard, during his youth after retirement. 
                    The stark contrast between the main character thoughts and philosophy during the two times is insightful.
                    The adventures during his youth are intriguing compared to his now dull life as a barkeeper, leaving the reader 
                    intriguied to know what inspired this drastic change in lifestyle.</p>
